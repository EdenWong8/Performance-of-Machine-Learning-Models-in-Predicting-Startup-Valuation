# Performance-of-Machine-Learning-Models-in-Predicting-Startup-Valuation

Traditional valuation methods like **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** and **Comparable Company Analysis (CCA)** often fall short when applied to startups due to limited historical data and high uncertainty. The project highlights how **machine learning models** improves investment decisions for **venture capitalists**, helps **entrepreneurs** tailor pitches to key valuation drivers and enables **financial analysts** to deliver more precise valuations. It showcases my ability to combine financial expertise with Python Programming skills to provide data-driven insights for better investment outcomes.

# Project Highlights

**a. Valuation Techniques Compared:**

**Traditional Methods**: DCF & CCA

**Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Decision Trees, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net


**b. Data & Methodology:**

**Dataset**: 2,000+ startups sourced from Crunchbase

**Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance

**Evaluation Metrics**: Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (nRMSE) and R-squared (R²)

# Key Findings

1. **Random Forest** outperformed other models with the **lowest nRMSE (0.1602)** and **highest R² (0.3814)**, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness.
